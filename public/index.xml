      <description>PURPOSE I chose this topic as there are a lot that goes into the production of food. My concern was raised as I noticed that people with various disorders are struggling to get the food items they can have. By this I mean, people with Crohnâ€™s disease, restrictive diets due to genetics (dysautonomia, EDS, ANS, etc), as well as many others. Medications can make the lack of proper foods tolerable, but it does not solve the overall issue they have.</description>

      <description>My name is Jorden and I have been working with data for as long as I can remember. It was only recently that I took interest in the more artistic side of it.
I started out in the US Marine Corps where the main skills are accountability, adaptability, and teamwork. After my exit from active duty, I went into retail where the key focus is attention to detail, time management, and communication.</description>
