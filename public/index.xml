      <description>During my schooling, cleaning was really only covered regarding spreadsheets. Even in the advanced courses, where python dominates, there is little coverage on what using pre-compiled datasets and handling any problems you come across. So, as I run into them, I will be logging them here and other posts as required depending on the error type.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This topic was chosen as there is a lot that goes into the production of food. A level of concern was raised as it became obvious that people with various disorders are struggling to get the food items they can have. By this it is meant, those with Crohnâ€™s disease, restrictive diets due to genetics (dysautonomia, EDS, ANS, etc), as well as many others. Medications can make the lack of proper foods tolerable, but it does not solve the overall issue they have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am a data analysis and caregiving professional with a Google Data Analytics Certificate and multiple courses on data fundamentals, data-driven decision making, and data preparation. I have acquired skills in PostgreSQL, databases, and spreadsheets, and I can collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data to solve real-world problems and create value for organizations and communities. I am currently working on my Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.
I have also demonstrated my leadership and management skills as a General Manager at Papa Johns, where I trained shift managers, worked with the Area Manager, completed weekly inventory and sales data, and created staff schedules.</description>
