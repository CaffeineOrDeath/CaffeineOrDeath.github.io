&lt;p&gt;This topic was chosen as there is a lot that goes into the production of food. A level of concern was raised as it became obvious that people with various disorders are struggling to get the food items they can have. By this it is meant, those with Crohnâ€™s disease, restrictive diets due to genetics (dysautonomia, EDS, ANS, etc), as well as many others. Medications can make the lack of proper foods tolerable, but it does not solve the overall issue they have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Jorden has been working with data for as long as he can remember. It was only recently that he took interest in the more artistic side of it. He has come to call this, &amp;ldquo;data beautification&amp;rdquo;.
Jorden started out in the US Marine Corps where the main skills are accountability, adaptability, and teamwork. After his exit from active duty, he went into retail where the key focus is attention to detail, time management, and communication.</description>
