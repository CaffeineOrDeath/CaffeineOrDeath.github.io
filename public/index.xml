      <description>This is simply a list of all of the websites I use to get the data for the topics that I come across. The list includes both open-source and commercial datasets.
Data.gov is a data source for United States governmental data. With over 250,000 datasets, there is a lot to choose from.
Census.gov is a data source regarding infrastructure, economics, commercial investments, and so much more.
Google Cloud, as of this post, has just over 200 free datasets available.</description>

      <title>KeyError Problems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my schooling, cleaning was really only covered regarding spreadsheets. Even in the advanced courses, where python dominates, there is little coverage on what to be on the look out for when using pre-compiled datasets and handling any problems you come across. So, as I run into them, I will be logging them here and other posts as required depending on the error type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This topic was chosen as there is a lot that goes into the production of food. A level of concern was raised as it became obvious that people with various disorders are struggling to get the food items they can have. By this it is meant, those with Crohnâ€™s disease, restrictive diets due to genetics (dysautonomia, EDS, ANS, etc), as well as many others. Medications can make the lack of proper foods tolerable, but it does not solve the overall issue they have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
