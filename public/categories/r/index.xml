      <description>PURPOSE I chose this topic as there are a lot that goes into the production of food. My concern was raised as I noticed that people with various disorders are struggling to get the food items they can have. By this I mean, people with Crohnâ€™s disease, restrictive diets due to genetics (dysautonomia, EDS, ANS, etc), as well as many others. Medications can make the lack of proper foods tolerable, but it does not solve the overall issue they have.</description>
