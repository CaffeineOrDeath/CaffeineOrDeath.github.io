      <description>This is simply a list of all of the websites I use to get the data for the topics that I come across. The list includes both open-source and commercial datasets.
Data.gov is a data source for United States governmental data. With over 250,000 datasets, there is a lot to choose from.
Census.gov is a data source regarding infrastructure, economics, commercial investments, and so much more.
Google Cloud, as of this post, has just over 200 free datasets available.</description>
