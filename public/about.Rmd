title: About

My name is Jorden and I have been working with data for as long as I can remember. It was only recently that I took interest in the more artistic side of it.

I started out in the US Marine Corps where the main skills are accountability, adaptability, and teamwork. After my exit from active duty, I went into retail where the key focus is attention to detail, time management, and communication. Eventually, I made my way to being a General Manager of a restaurant. All of the skills I picked up, from data analyzation to critical thinking and research, showed me my love for data. The stories it can tell go deeper than any book ever could.

Now, I’m looking forward to helping people achieve the best possible outcome with the data they have. From making better decisions in purchases to businesses providing service for the people. I’m here to help.
