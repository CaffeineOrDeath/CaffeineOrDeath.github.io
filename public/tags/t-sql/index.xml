      <description>&lt;p&gt;This started out as a guided project to learn T-SQL(MSSQLSERVER), SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS), and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). However, I realized something a little&amp;hellip; weird. Doing a little digging, we know that the Small Business Administration (SBA) is a federal program. The SBA connects entrepreneurs with lenders to help small businesses keep their doors open and employees paid. A little more digging and we find articles saying the same thing I&amp;rsquo;m going to say. While it had it&amp;rsquo;s use and it helped keep the economy from collapsing, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think about the affect this had on the national debt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
