                Welcome to Krampus' lair!
            </h3>
            <p>
                Krampus has had a bad reputation, but we're here to fix that.
                We're taking your problems and fixing them with all of 
                the toys in our bag.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Whether you need some help figuring out the problem, or have
                something you don't have time to make, we're here to snatch your
                problems and gift you sweet relief.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                What do we mean when we say '<strong>toys in our bag</strong>'? Well, people
                always tell us we buy things for nothing, right? Here's our
                chance to to put it to real use. From 3D prints to ECE, hardware
                to software, embedded systems to general purpose. If we
                don't have it, we <strong>WILL</strong> find someone who does so you can focus on
                you.
